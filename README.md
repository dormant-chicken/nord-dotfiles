# dotfiles
Here are my dotfiles for waybar, wofi, and my hyprland config

Install these packages before using these dotfiles:

`ttf-roboto-mono`
`ttf-font-awesome`

You can find the GTK theme, icons, and cursors that I use at gnome-look.org. They are linked down below:

[Nordic GTK theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1267246/)

[Stylish icon theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1886541)

[Bibata classic cursor](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1914826)

You can change the GTK theme, icon theme, cursor theme, and more using [NWG-look](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-look).

> [!NOTE]
> NWG-look will change your wofi theme based on your GTK theme.

The wallpaper that I use can be found in the hypr folder.
