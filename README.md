# dotfiles
My dotfiles for waybar, wofi, and my hyprland config

Run these commands on arch before using the dotfiles:

```
sudo pacman -S ttf-font-awesome
```
```
sudo pacman -S ttf-roboto-mono
```
You can find the GTK theme, icons, and cursors that I use at gnome-look.org, linked down below:

[Nordic GTK theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1267246/)

[Stylish icon theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1886541)

[Bibata classic cursor](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1914826)

You can apply the GTK theme using [NWG-look](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-look).

> [!NOTE]
> Applying a GTK theme with NWG-look will change the wofi theme too, so there is no need for using custom wofi dotfiles unless you want to, as your GTK theme will have their own.
